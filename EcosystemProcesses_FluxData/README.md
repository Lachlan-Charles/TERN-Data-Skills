## Ecosystem Processes (OzFlux)

This section of the TERN's Data Skills Development Program contains tutorials on how to access and use data on gas and energy exchange between the ecosystem and atmosphere collected, assembled, and maintained by the OzFlux towers of TERN's Ecosystem Processes platform.

### TERN's data on Gas and Energy fluxes

A network of micrometeorological flux tower stations (OxFlux towers) around Australia provide a common set of core measurements at different ecosystems and multiple times. Measurements include fluxes (i.e. exchange) of C02, water vapour, and energy between a terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere, as well as meteorological data (wind, precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, humidity). These measurements can improve understanding of Ecosystem Functioning, Biogeochemical Cycles, and Climate Adaptation, as well supply valuable information for land management and mitigation policies.
