TERN Surveillance Monitoring,http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/ausplots,"<p> AusPlots is a collection of ecological data and samples gathered from a network of plots and transects across Australia by the TERN Ecosystem Surveillance team, using standardised methodologies. </p> <p>The AusPlots collection provides the ecological infrastructure to: </p> <ul><li>quantify the richness and cover of plant species (including weeds); </li><li>quantify the diversity and abundance of soil biodiversity; </li><li>assess the state, spatial heterogeneity and structural complexity of vegetation, including life-stage; </li><li>record vegetation and soil parameters that assist with the validation of remotely sensed ecological products;</li><li>analyse vegetation structure and change based on a series of photo reference images; </li><li>better estimate soil carbon and nutrient stocks; </li><li>conduct taxonomic validation studies based on collected plant voucher specimens; </li><li>conduct DNA barcoding and population genetic profiling based on collected tissue samples. </li></ul> <p> Overall this information will progress understanding of ecosystem processes, structure and function, and more generally progress understanding of the response to disturbance and longer-term environmental change of rangeland ecosystems, which underpins sustainable management practice.</p>.",2022-04-06,"Sparrow, B. , Tokmakoff, A. , Leitch, E. , Guerin, G. , O'Neill, S. , Macdonald, C. , Lowe, A. , Flitton, R. , Saleeba, T. , Coish, C. and TERN Surveillance",TERN,"Sparrow, B. , Tokmakoff, A. , Leitch, E. , Guerin, G. , O'Neill, S. , McDonald, C. , Lowe, A. , Flitton, R. , Saleeba, T. , Coish, C. and TERN Surveillance (2021).
