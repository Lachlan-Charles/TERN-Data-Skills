This tutorial shows how to manipulate [EcoPlots's](https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/) plot ecological data downloads using R. This document usses the following libraries: `tidyverse`, `kablExtra`, `fs`, `easystats` and `bookdown` libraries.

# TL;DR

* EcoPlots's ecological data model is observation- and site-centric. Typically, an  observations will belong to a site and will have a site-visit see Figure \@ref(fig:datamodel) below for a graphical representation of concepts and their association.
  * Observations (e.g. number of flowers, plant canopu area and plant biomass in \@ref(fig:datamodel)) are done on [features of interest](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#feature-of-interest) (real world objects you are interested in studying, measuring or observing; the plants (Eucalyptus and Cycad) in Figure \@ref(fig:datamodel)). 
  * All entities in the data model have id's (e.g. observations, FOI's, vocabularies, methods and instruments)
    * Unique Resource Identifiers i.e. (unique sequence of characters) are used for generating the id's 
    * The URI's can be used to locate and get information about that entity (e.g. check out the URI for animal occurrence here [http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2361dea8-598c-4b6f-a641-2b98ff199e9e](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2361dea8-598c-4b6f-a641-2b98ff199e9e))
* Multiple observations can be done in a feature of interest (FOI). In figure \@ref(fig:datamodel) the Eucalyptus tree (FOI p34rdc) has observations on number of flowers and plant canopy.   
* Data downloaded from the EcoPlots plataform comes in a longer format.
  * `featureId` and `observationId` are unique keys for a feature and observation, respectively. These two identifiers are the work-horses for joining and transforming tables (e.g. from the longer to a wider format).
* See the [TERN Ontology](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/overview) for more information on our data model and [the conceptual overview of the model](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model).

# TERN's data model
First things first, some background:
 	
* The TERN data model is observation-centric
* Each observation belongs to a [feature of interest](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#feature-of-interest) (FOI, i.e. the real world object you are interested on and are measuring things about)
* This model differentiate between [parameters](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#observations) (i.e. observations, things that are measured directly on the FOI) and [attributes](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#non-core-attributes) (measurements related to to the FOI and other data entities).
* TERN Ontology's main focus is to represent site-based ecological surveys. Meaning, that [site](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#site) and [site visits](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#site-visit) are central to the description of the observations (the model can also describe other data types, e.g. occurrence data)
  * A [site](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/5bf7ae21-a454-440b-bdd7-f2fe982d8de4) is a land area selected from within a survey region where the sampling occurs (e.g. plot, transect, quadrat). 
  * [site-visits](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/f5c125b1-81c2-448c-81e6-7ff6a2facd07) are a discrete time when the surveys within the site occurred.


An FOI can have many observations. You can make observations on the height, diameter, wood density of a single tree (see Figure \@ref(fig:datamodel)). Similarly, observations and FOIs can have multiple attributes. For instance, reliability and/or accuracy of an observation are attributes, as well as notes on an observation or sample sizes. 

# EcoPlots download
To download Ecoplots data visit the portal [https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/](https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/). Once in there click on the search plot data button to explore (cirlced in red in the figure below, Figure \@ref(fig:landing))

```{r landing, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots landing page"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-landing.png")
```

Below you can see a snapshot of the EcoPlots data grid (Figure \@ref(fig:grid)). Using the facets (marked in red on the left hand side of Figure \@ref(fig:grid)) you can filter to specific databases, regions, feature types,  parameters and dates (not shown). Once you have selected the data that you want to query you can trigger a download clicking the add to cart button (top left corner, marked in blue in Figure \@ref(fig:grid)). After adding items to your cart, if you have not already done so,  you will be prompted to sign in to download the data. 

```{r grid, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots facets and data grid"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-grid.png")
```

In the download page you can give your download a title and description (see Figure \@ref(fig:download)).
```{r download, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots download"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-download.png")
```

Once you received your download you can always come back to it later (up to two weeks) and if you want to you can keep a permanent copy of it to share by minting a DOI (Figure \@ref(fig:doi) under actions button circled in red)

```{r doi, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots download mint"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-mint.png")
```


Now let's look at a EcoPlots download. IN the code chunk below we show a download example for [plant specimen data](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2e122e23-881c-43fa-a921-a8745f016ceb) from the TERN Ecosystem Surveillance database [@Sparrow2022]. 

An EcoPlots download comes in a `package` that contains:

* `bag-info.txt` with:
  * **citation**
  * link to the metadata record
  * licensing
  * download information (e.g. link and download date)
* data folder that contains:
  * Citation in a `.bib` format **citation.bib**
  * Site and site attributes file
    * If other sampling units are used then a file for the sampling unit is included. A transect file is included when the sampling takes place inside a transect inside a site.
  * Site visit and site visit attributes file
  * FOI observations file
  * FOI attributes file
    * If the FOI is an organism then a taxon file is included
  * Data dictionary for all columns in all files

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dir_tree("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/", recurse= TRUE)
```


Structure and relationships between the data types are provided using URI's. All definitions, methods, and even observations in a data download will have a URI, in the tables this URIs are identified with the `Id` suffix.

## Long to wide format
The basic columns of the longer format tables are:

* `featureType` is a human readable name for the feature which observation we are interested on. A complete list of all feature types can be found [here](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewer/tern/id/http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/68af3d25-c801-4089-afff-cf701e2bd61d)
* `featureId` column contains single unique identifier for each individual feature
* `parametersName` column that contains the names of the columns in the wide format
* `result` column for sourcing the values that will be used to fill in the named columns above

In general, the conversion from longer to wider format should be achieved by using `featureType` and `featureId` as unique identifiers, the `parametersName` that literally contains the name of the parameters performed on the FOI (observations) and `result` that is the value for a given observation. 
  
In pseudo-code the transformation looks something like the steps below

```
#Reading in the data
data = read_csv("<PACKAGE>/data/<FOI>_observations.csv", na = "N/A")

#Pivoting (i.e. transforming) the data from longer format to wider format
# using the FOI as an id, the parametersName for the column names and results as the values to fill in the rows with
data_wide = pivot_function(id_cols =(featureId), names_column = parametersName, values_column = result)
```

The pseudo-code above should transform a longer table  where the observation names are in `parametersName`
and the observation values in `result` to a wide table format with features as rows and columns as parameters as below (Table \@ref(tab:l2w)).

```{r l2w, echo= FALSE}
long <- tibble(featureType=c("plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence "),
featureTypeId=c("plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition"),

# Data manipulation examples with EcoPlots Download

Below we provide examples of how to manipulate site, site-visit and FOI tables, we show how to:

* Transform tables from a wider format (e.g. with a column for each type of observation)
  * **site table does not require transformation** (i.e. each site attribute already has its own column) 
  * site attributes tables
  * FOI and FOI attributes tables
* Join tables
  * Site and site attribute tables
  * FOI with FOI attributes tables
  * site and FOI tables
  * FOI's with environmental variables

## Transforming tables

EcoPlots download comes in a longer format. Below we show on how to transform the long format to a wider format using site data and plant occurrence data. The basic workflow is to first identifying the unique id's that link multiple observations (appended with `id`, see Figure \@ref(fig:foi-transform-pic)), then identifying the columns that contain the column names (e.g. for FOI's `parameters` and for attributes `attributeName`) and finally the columns that contain the observations/values (e.g. for FOI's `result` and for attributes `values`). In the image below we provide an example of id's linking multiple observations to a single FOI.

```{r foi-transform-pic, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Unique identifier link multiple observations to their FOI"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/foi-transform.png")

```


### Transform site attributes table

Each site attribute has an URI, and points to a site through a `siteId` (Table \@ref(tab:site-att)). 
```{r site-att-read, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read in table
site_att <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/site_attribute_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A") 

```


```{r site-att, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# site_att %>%
#   kbl() %>%
#   kable_paper() %>% 
#   scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px")


kbl(site_att, caption = "**Site attribute table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 
#transform from wide to long format

```


To transform the site attributes table (Table \@ref(tab:site-att)) to the wider format (Table \@ref(tab:site-att-to-wide-dis)) the `siteId` can be used as the unique key,  the `attributeName` for the names of the columns, and the `value` column for the values.

```{r, site-att-to-wide, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#read in table
site_att %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(siteId),names_from = attributeName,values_from= value)-> site_att_wide
```

```{r, site-att-to-wide-dis, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

kbl(site_att_wide, caption = "**Site attribute wider table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 

```

### Transform FOI observations and attributes tables

We first load the plant specimen data (Table \@ref(tab:plant-table)).

```{r, plantLong, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

plant_specimen_long <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/plant-specimen_observations_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A")
```


```{r plant-table, echo = FALSE}
out <- slice_sample(plant_specimen_long,n = 50)

kbl(out, caption = "**Plant specimen longer table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 


```

 Then we transform the table into wide format using as keys `siteName, siteId, siteVisitName,transectName, featureId`. Notice how after transformation each parameter exist in its own column (Table \@ref(tab:psw)). 

```{r psw-pivot}
plant_specimen_long %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result) -> plant_specimen_wide
```


```{r psw, echo = FALSE}
kbl(plant_specimen_wide, caption = "**Plant specimen wider table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 


```


The same transformation can be done with the FOI attributes tables. Once we read in the data we can use the `featureId` as unique identifier for the features. The column names are stored in  `attributeName` and their values in `value` column. The end result is a table with a row for each feature (i.e. each plant specimen) and each of their attributes as columns (Table \@ref(tab:foi-att-wide)). 

```{r, foi-att, message=FALSE}
plant_specimen_att_long <- read_csv(file = "data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/plant-specimen_feature_attribute_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A")

#transform from longer to wider format
plant_specimen_att_long %>%
pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId),names_from = attributeName,values_from= value)-> plant_specimen_att_wide
```

 



```{r,foi-att-wide, echo = FALSE}

kbl(plant_specimen_att_wide, caption = "**Plant specimen attributes wider table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 

```

### Join tables
Below we show how to join tables. For joing tables the only thing we need is to identify the unique id's that link multiple observations to a feature. For sites and their attributes this is the `siteId`, for FOI's and their attributes this is the `featureId`. For joining different  FOI's the common `id` would be the `siteId`. 


### Join site, site-visit
Sites and their attributes can be joined using their common id's (i.e.`siteId` column). Here we load the site table and use the site attribute wider table from above (Table \@ref(tab:site-all)).


```{r, site-read, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

## site attribute load 
<<site-att-read>>

#site attr transform
<<site-att-to-wide>>

# site table load
site <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/site_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A") 

#join tables
site_all <- left_join(site, site_att_wide, by = c("siteId"))

```


```{r site-all, message=FALSE}

kbl(site_all, caption = "**Site table with attributes**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "1000px", height = "200px") 

```



### FOI tables with FOI attributes tables

The FOI's id (i.e. `featureId`) can be used to join attributes to their observations

```{r, join-foi-obs-att, message=FALSE}
#we load the plant specimen data
<<plantLong>>
#and transform it from longer to wider format
<<psw-pivot>>

#We do the same for its attributes
<<foi-att>>

#finalyy we join the data using the commond key, inthis case the featureId
plant_observations_joined <- left_join(plant_specimen_wide, plant_specimen_att_wide, by = "featureId")
```

### FOI with sites

The common key between an FOI and a site table is the `siteId`, to join an FOI with site data we use this key. 

```{r, join-site-foi}

plants_site <- left_join(site_all, plant_observations_joined, by = "siteId")

```

```{r,plant-site-tbl, message=FALSE}
#show join

plants_site %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)%>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")
```

```{r,foi-site-tbl, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#show join

plants_site %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)%>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")
```



### Join two FOI's

Information between FOI's can be join using the `siteId` key. In the example below we show how to join data on precipitation to plant species richness to explore their relationship. Macroecological studies have show species richness increases along gradients in precipitation [e.g. @currie1991energy; @harrison2020climate]. To analyse this relationship at a continental scale we use TERN Ecosystem Surveillance database [@Sparrow2022].

After obtaining the [plant specimen](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2e122e23-881c-43fa-a921-a8745f016ceb) and [climate](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/6d40d71e-58cd-4f75-8304-40c01fe5f74c) data from EcoPlots, we:

1. Load the tables for both FOI's (i.e. climate and plant specimen)

```{r, load-fois,message=FALSE}
#load climate
climate <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_470a7deeb93411ec9ad65ac04d8860c6/data/climate_observations_4ea343b4c06ff7e7ae998e498263761c.csv", na = "N/A")


plant_specimen <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_470a7deeb93411ec9ad65ac04d8860c6/data/plant-specimen_observations_4ea343b4c06ff7e7ae998e498263761c.csv", na = "N/A")

```

2. Transform the tables from their long format to a wider format.
  * In the case of the climate data we can filter the only variable that we need (precipitation), this can be done directly in EcoPlots' facet or filtering the parameter in R (e.g. `filter(parameter == "precipitation annual mean")`). 

```{r, rain-trans,message=FALSE}

climate %>%
  filter(parameter == "precipitation annual mean") %>% #notice that we select only precipitation, this can be done in EcoPlots
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result)-> climate_wide


```

  * Plant specimens data is transform to wide format using the same keys as the climate data.

```{r, rich-trans,message=FALSE}

plant_specimen %>%
pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result) -> plant_specimen_wide



```

3. Generate species richness and precipitation tables at the site level. Precipitation is a long term average see [here](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/cb2a4d5a-090c-431a-88fe-72afe197c35d). 
  * So one record can be selected at the site level, independent of the number of site visits. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
climate_wide %>% #long term climate is 
  group_by(siteId) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>% 
  select(-siteVisitId)-> climate_wide
```
  
  * For calculating plant species richness we can use the the number of rows (i.e. unique number of scientific names) at the site-level. 
  
```{r, message=FALSE}
plant_specimen_wide %>%
  group_by(siteId, siteVisitId) %>%
  count(name = 'richness') %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  group_by(siteId) %>%
  summarise(mean_richness =round(mean(richness, na.rm =TRUE), digits = 0))->plant_richness
```

4. Join the tables. Finally we can join the precipitation and richness tables using their common key (i.e. `siteId`). For making data manipulation easy we transform the spaces in the column names to underscores. 
```{r}

plant_env <- left_join(plant_richness, climate_wide, by = c("siteId")) %>%
  select(-featureId) %>% # we do not need the featureId anymore%>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~ gsub(pattern = " ", replacement = "_", x = .x)) %>%
  mutate(mean_richness = as.integer(mean_richness), precipitation_annual_mean= as.numeric(precipitation_annual_mean)) %>%
  filter(precipitation_annual_mean> 0)# we make sure that our variables are numeric


plant_env %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)%>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

```


5. Visualize and analyse the data. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(plant_env, aes(y = mean_richness, x = precipitation_annual_mean))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = F, 
              method.args = list(family = "poisson"), linetype = "dashed")+
  theme_bw()

mod <- glm(mean_richness~precipitation_annual_mean, family = poisson, data = plant_env)
model_parameters(mod)

```

## Biomass data across Ecosystems

We assume that the biomass data has been downloaded following the instructions in section 3.

Once the data is downloaded: 

1. Load the plant individual observation table    

```{r,warning=FALSE}
#load plant individual observations
plant_ind <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_90d9bacb451511ed97e19e8d173ce220/data/plant-individual_observations_6b925a2aec8235ec69496a813ae7eef3.csv", na = "N/A")
```

2. Transform the table from their long format to a wider format.
  * In the case of the plant individual observation data we can separate the parameter values into the groups that we need (above-ground biomass and scientific name). 

```{r}
#separate parameters into wide format.  For this example we will retain the site name, longitude, latitude, date of sampling (siteVisitName) and the featureId 
plant_ind %>%
pivot_wider(id_cols=c(siteName,latitude,longitude,siteVisitName,featureId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result) -> plant_ind_wide

#amend above-ground biomass, scientific names and siteVisitName (year) column names
colnames(plant_ind_wide)[4]<-"year"
colnames(plant_ind_wide)[6]<-"scientific_name"
colnames(plant_ind_wide)[7]<-"above_ground_biomass"

##obtain the year of sampling only
plant_ind_wide$year<- substr(plant_ind_wide$year,1,4)
```

3. We will aggregate above-ground biomass by site and sampling year and visualise the result

```{r}
#before aggregating data, convert above_ground_biomass to a numeric value
plant_ind_wide$above_ground_biomass<-as.numeric(plant_ind_wide$above_ground_biomass)

#aggregate by site and sampling year
plant_ind_wide%>%
	group_by(siteName,year)%>%
	summarize(site_level_biomass_kgs=sum(above_ground_biomass,na.rm=TRUE))->summed_site_level_biomass

#plot sites where biomass was sampled in 2015

site_biomass_for_plotting<-subset(summed_site_level_biomass,year=="2015")

## convert kgs to tonnes/ha

site_biomass_for_plotting$above_ground_biomass_tonnes_per_ha<-site_biomass_for_plotting$site_level_biomass_kgs/1000

## load ggplot
library(ggplot2)

plot1<-ggplot(site_biomass_for_plotting, aes(x = siteName, y = above_ground_biomass_tonnes_per_ha))+geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey65")+labs(x="Site",y="Above ground biomass (tonnes/ha)")

plot1+theme_bw() +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```


4. Now we will aggregate the above-ground biomass by species within sites, by sampling year.

```{r}
#aggregate above-ground biomass by site, date and species name
plant_ind_wide%>%
	group_by(siteName,year,scientific_name)%>%
	summarize(species_level_biomass_kgs=sum(above_ground_biomass,na.rm=TRUE))->summed_species_level_biomass
```

5. Create figure that show the change in species above-ground biomass in a site over different time periods.

```{r}
#using the Alice Mulga site as an example, graph the change in above-ground biomass for each species over time

#subset data for the Alice Mulga site
Alice_mulga<-subset(summed_species_level_biomass,siteName=="Alice Mulga, core1ha")

#plot species biomass by year
plot2<-ggplot(Alice_mulga, aes(x = scientific_name, y = species_level_biomass_kgs,fill=year))+geom_col(position="dodge")+labs(x="Species",y="Above ground biomass (kg)")

plot2+theme_bw() +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
