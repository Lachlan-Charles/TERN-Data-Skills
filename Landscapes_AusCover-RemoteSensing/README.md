## Landscape Assessment (AusCover) - Remote Sensing

This section of the TERN's Data Skills Development Program contains tutorials on how to access and use remote sensing data using R. 

Tutorials include:

* *'Using Raster Data in R'*: This tutorial explores in detail how to create, load, navigate, save, inspect, summarise, modify, combine, and use raster data in R, with the help of synthetic examples.

* *'Green Vegetation Temporal Dynamics: Monitoring and Analysis using NDVI and Fractional Cover TERN rasters'*: A two parts tutorial that explores how to monitor and analyse the temporal dynamics of green vegetation, by using TERN's data on seasonal surface reflectance and green cover fraction.

### TERN Remote Sensing Data

TERN Remote Sensing data includes validated geodata from satellite and airborne platforms such as aircraft and drones. These data result from the collaboration of over 12 Australian government and academic institutions. This collaboration  provides a nationally consistent methodology for the calibration of instruments, as well as the collection, validation, and delivery of geodata products. The resulting geodata products enable researches and resource managers to assess and investigate the state and dynamics of Australian environments.
