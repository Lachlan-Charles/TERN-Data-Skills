### Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia 

The Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia provides consistent, comprehensive, nation-wide data on Australian soil and landscape attributes at a fine resolution (3 arc-seconds ~ 90x90m pixels; finer than ever before). It draws together historical data and new data generated from sampling, laboratory sensing, modelling and remote sensing. These data has a wide range of applications and users including urban and regional planners, land managers, farming groups, scientists and engineers.
